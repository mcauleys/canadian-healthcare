The company offers patients and healthcare providers therapeutic options that manage acute medical conditions to improve health and quality of life. The company has two marketed, in-hospital cardiology products, AGGRASTAT and BRINAVESS. In addition, it has licensed the marketing rights to various products, such as ESMOCARD and ESMOCARD LYO; a pre-registration drug/device combination product, TREVYENT; an European-approved antibiotic, XYDALBA; and a cephalosporin antibiotic, ZEVTERA/MABELIO. Products and Product Candidates AGGRASTAT (tirofiban hydrochloride) is a reversible GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (an intravenous anti-platelet drug) for use in patients with acute coronary syndrome. AGGRASTAT is commercially available in markets outside of the United States, and is registered and approved in approximately 60 countries worldwide. In 2017, the company announced the signing of a license and distribution agreement with ZAO Firma Euroservice that would advance AGGRASTAT towards commercialization in Russia. BRINAVESS (vernakalant (IV)) is an atrial-selective antiarrhythmic agent, which was approved in the European Union in 2010, and is registered and approved in approximately 40 countries (not including the United States) for the conversion of onset atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm in adults, for non-surgery patients with AF of seven days or less and for use in post-cardiac surgery patients with AF of three days or less. BRINAVESS is mentioned as a first-line therapy in the European Society of Cardiology AF guidelines for the cardioversion of onset AF in patients with no, or minimal/moderate, structural heart disease. Both AGGRASTAT and BRINAVESS are commercially available outside of the United States, through the company’s own direct sales force within Europe, as well as through the company’s worldwide distributor and partner network. The company has a worldwide distributor and partner network that allows its products to be commercialized in various countries worldwide. ESMOCARD and ESMOCARD LYO, a short acting beta blocker, are indicated for the treatment of supraventricular tachycardia (except for pre-excitation syndromes) and for the control of the ventricular rate in patients with AF in perioperative, postoperative, or other circumstances where short-term control of the ventricular rate with a short-acting agent is desirable. ESMOCARD and ESMOCARD LYO are also indicated for tachycardia and hypertension occurring in the perioperative phase and non-compensatory sinus tachycardia where, in the physician’s judgement, the rapid heart rate requires specific intervention. ESMOCARD and ESMOCARD LYO are not intended for use in chronic settings. The company has launched ESMOCARD and ESMOCARD LYO in Italy and France. TREVYENT is a development stage drug/device combination product that combines SteadyMed Ltd’s (SteadyMed) PatchPump technology, a drug delivery device, with treprostinil, a vasodilatory prostacyclin analogue to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

The company has two collaboration and license agreements (the ‘collaboration agreements’) with Merck for the development and commercialization of vernakalant. The collaboration agreements provided an affiliate of Merck with exclusive rights outside of North America to vernakalant (IV). In February 2018, the company’s partner, ATCO Laboratories Ltd., filed a marketing authorization application in Pakistan seeking approval of BRINAVESS. In August 2018, the company announced results from a clinical survey assessing patients with acute AF in Belgian hospitals demonstrating reduced hospitalization in patients treated with BRINAVESS. As a result of these data, BRINAVESS received reimbursement approval from the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance in Belgium. The company has an exclusive license and supply agreement (the ‘license agreement’) with SteadyMed to commercialize the development-stage product TREVYENT (treprostinil) in Europe, Canada, and the Middle East. Pursuant to the license agreement, SteadyMed granted the company an exclusive royalty-bearing license to commercialize TREVYENT in Europe, Canada, and the Middle East if TREVYENT is approved for the treatment of PAH in such regions. In 2017, the company entered into a distribution and license agreement with Basilea Pharmaceutica International Ltd. for the rights to commercialize ZEVTERA/MABELIO (ceftobiprole medocaril sodium) in 34 European countries and Israel. Foreign Operations The company has operations in various countries in Europe, the United States and Canada. Its direct sales force responsible for the sale and promotion of all its products are primarily based in Europe. Strategy The company’s core strategy is to offer patients and healthcare providers innovative therapeutic options that effectively, safely, and conveniently manage acute medical conditions to improve health and quality of life.

In collaboration with commercial and academic partners, the company is also expanding the application of DPX as a delivery platform for other applications. The company intends to be opportunistic in the development of products by exploring various avenues, including co-development through collaborations, strategic partnerships or other transactions with third parties. The company might seek additional equity and non-dilutive funding and partnerships to advance the development of its product candidates. Platform and Products in Development DPX-Survivac DPX-Survivac, the company’s cancer immunotherapy candidate, uses survivin-based peptides licensed from Merck KGaA on a worldwide exclusive basis that are formulated in DPX. DPX-Survivac leverages the mechanism of action (MOA) of DPX to generate a constant flow of T cells in the blood that are targeted against survivin expressed on cancer cells, and it includes five minimal MHC class I peptides designed to activate naïve T cells against survivin. DPX-Survivac is being tested in 6 different cancer indications through multiple phase 2 clinical trials. Monotherapy: The DeCidE1 phase 2 study is an open label safety and efficacy study for individuals with advanced platinum-sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer with sum of base line target lesions per Recist criteria approximately five centimeters. In March 2019, preliminary data from the phase 2 cohort of the Decide clinical study. This amended phase 2 study evaluates the safety and efficacy of DPX-Survivac monotherapy with monotherapy with intermittent low-dose cyclophosphamide (mCPA) in patients with advanced recurrent ovarian cancer. In 2018, the company met with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in a Type B meeting to discuss the results of its DeCidE1 clinical trial and continuing development plan, as well as to obtain agency guidance on an accelerated regulatory pathway for DPX-Survivac as a T-cell immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with progressing disease. The purpose of the company’s Type B meeting with the FDA was to request feedback on the design of the clinical program for DPX-Survivac. This program includes the continuing DeCidE1 phase 2 clinical study and a future registration trial for accelerated approval in a subset of ovarian cancer patients. In addition, the company submitted a protocol amendment for a predictive enrichment approach to the phase 2 DeCidE1 trial, and further discussed those details with the FDA during the Type B meeting. Combinations: This phase 2 study is a triple-combination immunotherapy in patients with measurable or recurrent diffuse large B-cell lymphoma led by Sunnybrook Research Institute. This investigator sponsored trial, announced initially in May 2017, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DPX-Survivac, Merck’s pembrolizumab, and low-dose cyclophosphamide. DPX-Survivac stimulates the immune system to produce T cell responses targeting survivin. In September 2018, the company announced the expansion of its clinical program with a Phase 2 basket trial in collaboration with Merck evaluating its lead candidate, DPX-Survivac, in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide, and Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with select advanced or recurrent solid tumours. This is the third clinical trial evaluating the combination of DPX-Survivac, low dose cyclophosphamide, and pembrolizumab in advanced recurrent cancers. In February 2017, the company announced an investigator-sponsored phase 2 clinical trial in ovarian cancer in combination with Merck’s checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. In 2015, the company had entered into a non-exclusive clinical trial collaboration with Incyte Corporation (Incyte) to evaluate the combination of DPX-Survivac, with Incyte’s investigational oral IDO1 inhibitor, epacadostat. The investigational new drug (IND) application for the study was approved by the FDA and Health Canada in 2016. In 2017, the company provided positive topline clinical data. In April 2018, the company entered into an agreement with Incyte to expand the ongoing clinical trial collaboration. The companies added a phase 2 component to their ongoing phase 1b combination study. In November 2018, the company announced an amendment to its phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of DPX-Survivac in combination with either 100 mg or 300 mg of epacadostat in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. The company announced in 2016 that the European Medicines Agency had granted orphan drug designation status to the company’s DPX-Survivac in ovarian cancer. In 2015, the FDA also granted orphan drug status to DPX-Survivac for the treatment of ovarian cancer. This designation is valid for all applications of DPX-Survivac in ovarian cancer without restriction to a specific stage of disease. The company had previously received FDA fast track designation for DPX-Survivac. The designation is intended for patients with no measurable disease after their initial surgery and chemotherapy. Other Programs In January 2019, treatment of the first patient occurred in the phase 1 trial evaluating neoepitopes formulated in the company’s proprietary DPX delivery platform in patients with ovarian cancer. The study is part of the company’s DPX-NEO program, which is a continuing collaboration between UConn Health and the company to develop neoepitope-based anti-cancer therapies. DPX-E7 In 2017, the company announced that the first study participant has been treated in a phase 1b/2 clinical study evaluating an investigational cancer target for human papillomavirus (HPV) (E7) formulated in DPX and in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with incurable oropharyngeal, cervical and anal cancers related to HPV. Dana-Farber is leading the DPX-E7 study through a research grant from Stand Up To Cancer and the Farrah Fawcett Foundation to clinically evaluate collaborative translational research that addresses critical problems in HPV-related cancers. The Dana-Farber study is a single center, open label, non-randomized clinical trial that would investigate the safety and clinical efficacy in a total of 44 treated participants. The company has the option to produce the DPX-E7 vaccine if it proves successful in the clinical trials. The company expects to disclose results when provided by Dana-Farber. A component of the company’s business strategy is partnering the DPX platform within infectious and other diseases. The DPX platform has the potential to generate an immune response, in a single dose. The single-dose capability could prove to be beneficial in targeting diff","TSX:IMV

Its products include the Tiara technology for the transcatheter treatment of mitral valve disease; and the Neovasc Reducer for the treatment of refractory angina. The company was formerly known as Medical Ventures Corp. and changed its name to Neovasc Inc. in July 2008. Neovasc Inc. was incorporated in 2000 and is headquartered in Richmond, Canada.","Neovasc Inc., a specialty medical device company, develops, manufactures, and markets products for the cardiovascular marketplace. Products The company’s products include the Tiara technology in the development for the transcatheter treatment of mitral valve disease, and the Reducer for the treatment of refractory angina. Tiara In 2009, the company started initial activities to develop technologies for catheter-based treatment of mitral valve disease. In 2011, the company formally initiated a new project to develop the Tiara, a product for treating mitral valve disease. The transapically delivered Tiara is in the clinical trial phase providing a minimally invasive transcatheter device for patients who experience severe Mitral Regurgitation as a result of functional (most patients) or degenerative mitral heart valve disease, combined with an enlarged left ventricle. The company continues to conduct pre/post implant analysis to review the overall screening criteria. Additional field clinical engineering support has been established in Europe to provide patient screening and case support. The Tiara has successfully treated 16 patients with previous aortic valves, including mechanical, bioprosthetic and TAVI, without any LVOT obstruction, no peri-procedural deaths or paravalvular leak. The Tiara valve is made up of two major components, such as the leaflets, which are made from the Peripatch bovine tissue licensed from Boston Scientific, a fabric skirt, and the nitinol frame (to which the leaflets and skirt are attached), which is manufactured by a major specialty manufacturer in the medical device industry. The Tiara delivery system is manufactured, packaged and labelled in-house by the company using customized standard catheter construction components that are available through vendors. The company is managing and conducting the TIARA-II study itself in conjunction with certain service providers who undertake portions of data collection, data management, data analysis, safety and event monitoring and similar functions. The Tiara is manufactured for use in these studies by the company at its own facilities following required medical device quality requirements. In the event of a positive outcome from the TIARA-II study and the company successfully obtaining CE Mark approval, the Tiara would be commercially manufactured in the same manner at the company’s facility. Regulatory Status: The Tiara is an early-stage development product without regulatory approvals in any country. The company intends to continue to fund development of the product as cash flow allows and is targeting applying for CE Mark approval in Europe in approximately late 2020, assuming sufficient patients would have been enrolled with sufficient follow-up time by then. In 2016, the company announced that it had received both regulatory and ethics committee approval to initiate the TIARA-II study in Italy. Since then, the company has received regulatory and ethics committee approvals to conduct the study in Germany, Israel, Spain and the United Kingdom. Reducer The Reducer is a treatment for patients with refractory angina, a painful and debilitating condition that occurs when the coronary arteries deliver an inadequate supply of blood to the heart muscle, despite treatment with standard revascularization or cardiac drug therapies. The Reducer is targeting a patient population that has failed to gain relief of their symptoms, despite other medical treatment options. The Reducer is an hourglass-shaped, balloon-expandable, stainless steel, bare metal device, which is implanted in the coronary sinus, creating a restriction in venous outflow from the myocardium (the muscular layer of the heart wall). It is implanted using conventional percutaneous, or needle puncture, techniques. The Reducer is provided sterile and pre-loaded on a balloon catheter system. The system is 9 French sheath compatible and operates through a .035 inch guide wire. The company completed the COSIRA (Coronary Sinus Reducer for Treatment of Refractory Angina), a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Reducer device in 2013. In 2016, the company initiated the REDUCER-I observational study as a multi-center, multi-country, three-arm study collecting long-term data from European patients implanted with the Reducer. The study is expected to enroll approximately 400 patients. 190 patients have been enrolled across 20 centers that are active in Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Following the positive data from the COSIRA trial, the company initiated a pilot launch of the Reducer in select European markets in early 2015. The company has signed distribution agreements in multiple jurisdictions across Europe. Direct sales are underway in select centers in Germany. Based on the initial results from the targeted launch, the company has developed an expanded sales plan and strategy for 2019 and beyond. Regulatory Status: The Reducer is approved for sale in Europe, having received CE Mark designation in 2011. In preparation for product launch, the company completed the development of the commercial-generation Reducer and the product is in commercial scale manufacture. In 2017, the company received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for an U.S. investigational device exemption clinical trial, COSIRA II (a trial design similar to the COSIRA study). In October 2018, the company announced that the FDA has granted ‘Breakthrough Device Designation’ for the Reducer. The FDA grants this designation to expedite the development and review of a device that demonstrates potential to provide a treatment or diagnosis for life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases. In December 2018, the company filed a Q-Sub submission to the FDA with all available Reducer Clinical evidence, requesting a Sprint FDA discussion meeting. The Neovasc team, together with two major U.S. cardiologists, met with the FDA proposing moving forward with a premarket approval (PMA) submission using the company’s available clinical evidence, including the prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham controlled study assessing the safety and efficacy of the Reducer in 104 patients in the European Union and Canada (COSIRA), a multi-center, multi-country, three-arm observational post market study (REDUCER-I), and supportive safety and efficacy data from peer-reviewed journals. In February 2019, the company announced that the FDA had informed the company that, despite ‘Breakthrough Device Designation’, the FDA review team recommends collection of further pre-market blinded data prior to PMA submission. Through the Sprint discussion process, the company would continue discussions with the FDA and their senior management to attempt to bring this promising refractory angina device therapy to the U.S. patients as soon as possible. Marketing The company markets the Reducer through direct sales in Germany and through distributors for other countries in Europe and the Middle East. Strategy The company's core strategy is to focus on re-establishing trust and confidence with its stakeholders, to re-structure the company's financing, and to continue the development and commercialization of its products, the Tiara and the Reducer, providing minimally invasive medical devices for a cardiovascular market that is both growing and under-served by current treatment solutions.

The company is also developing a second SIRPaFc fusion protein, TTI-622. TTI-622 consists of the extracellular CD47-binding domain of human SIRPa linked to a human immunoglobulin G4 Fc region, which has a decreased ability to engage Fc receptors than an IgG1 Fc. The company initiated a phase 1 clinical trial for TTI-622 in June 2018. Both SIRPaFc fusion proteins enable CD47 blockade with various levels of Fc receptor engagement on macrophages. The company also has a medicinal chemistry platform that uses proprietary fluorine-based chemistry to yield new chemical entities. Its major advanced preclinical program stemming from this platform is an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist with uptake and retention in the brain. In addition, various compounds directed at undisclosed immuno-oncology targets are in the discovery phase. Strategy The key elements of the company’s strategy include to rapidly advance the clinical development of TTI-621; focus its TTI-621 clinical program on cancer indications; expand its portfolio of SIRPaFc constructs through advancement of TTI-622; and build a pipeline of novel oncology products using its proprietary medicinal chemistry platform. Intellectual Property In connection specifically with patent applications relating to SIRPaFc, the company controls two main patent families that include nineteen individual filings in all. One family claims the two species of SIRPaFc (TTI-621 and TTI-622) in clinical trials, and their anti-cancer use. These patent rights are owned outright by the company and patent filings have been arranged in the major pharmaceutical markets. Patents are granted in the United States, Australia, Japan and China. Patents emerging from this family begin to expire in 2033. A second SIRPa patent family was in-licensed on an exclusive basis from co-owners UHN and HSC. This family has been filed in the major markets, and patents are granted in Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia. The claims cover the use of various forms of SIRPa to treat CD47-positive cancers. Patents in this family begin to expire in the year 2029. History Trillium Therapeutics Inc. was founded in 2004. The company was incorporated in 2004.
